Efficient demand forecasting and inventory optimization are essential for XYZ Ltd., a leading heavy machinery manufacturer, to address challenges like fluctuating demand, overstocking, stockouts, and storage constraints. Here's a breakdown of the problem and the proposed solution:

---

### **Challenges**

1. **Fluctuating Demand**: Sales are influenced by seasonality, government budgets, and market conditions, making predictions difficult.
2. **Overstocking vs. Stockouts**: Overstocking leads to high holding costs, while stockouts result in missed sales opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.
3. **Storage Constraints**: The warehouse has a fixed capacity of 5000 cubic meters, necessitating efficient space utilization.

### **Proposed Solution**

#### **Demand Forecasting Model**
To predict demand accurately:
- **Techniques Used**: Time Series Forecasting models such as XGBoost, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and ARIMA.
- **Key Features Incorporated**:
  - Historical sales data
  - External factors like government budgets, market share trends, and seasonal patterns.

#### **Inventory Optimization Strategy**
To balance inventory levels effectively:
- **Approach**:
  - Adopt a Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory system to minimize holding costs.
  - Use optimization techniques like Linear Programming and Genetic Algorithms to allocate stock efficiently within the warehouse's capacity constraints.
- **Goals**:
  - Prevent overstocking or stockouts.
  - Ensure inventory levels align with forecasted demand while staying within the storage limit.
